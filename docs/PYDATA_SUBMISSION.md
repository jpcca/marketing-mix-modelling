## Proposal title
Designing AI-Augmented Research Workflows for Multilingual Collaboration

## Abstract
International and industry-academic research teams often operate across multiple native languages, making linguistic friction a structural challenge in complex projects. This talk presents a framework for integrating large language models into collaborative research workflows by combining transcript-based context preservation with test-driven feedback loops. Using a Bayesian modeling project as a case study, the focus is on workflow design rather than domain-specific techniques.

## Description
International and industry-academic collaborations frequently involve researchers with different native languages. Even when discussions are conducted in English, conceptual reasoning often occurs in each researcher’s first language, creating friction in maintaining shared context and aligning implementation decisions.

This talk proposes embedding large language models into the research process as part of a structured feedback loop. Automated meeting transcripts preserve project context with high fidelity, allowing discussions and design decisions to remain continuously accessible. Researchers can think and draft in their native languages while maintaining a coherent shared context.

At the same time, implementation requirements are formalized as executable tests and quantitative diagnostics. These tests generate objective feedback signals that guide LLM-assisted iteration, creating a disciplined loop between human intent, code generation, and measurable validation.

A Bayesian modeling project serves as a case study, but the emphasis is on workflow architecture rather than modeling technique. The session is conceptual with moderate technical depth and is intended for data scientists, research engineers, and technical leaders working in multilingual or cross-sector environments. No prior experience with probabilistic programming is required.

Attendees will gain a practical framework for designing AI-augmented research workflows that reduce linguistic barriers while preserving rigor and reproducibility.
